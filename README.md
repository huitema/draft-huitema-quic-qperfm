The QUIC multimedia performance protocol (QPERFM) updates the QUIC
performance protocol (QPERF).  QPERF provides a simple, general-
purpose protocol for testing the performance characteristics of a
QUIC implementation.  QPERFM updates that protocol to simulate the
traffic of multimedia application and measure performance in a multi-
media oriented way.
